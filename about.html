    <h1>About - BrightBucks ðŸŽ“</h1>
    <p class="headings">Who We Are</p>

    <p>We are a group of Computer Science Engineering students in our second year, passionate about using technology to make a difference. Our team came together with a shared vision to simplify the process of finding scholarships for students who need them the most.</p>
        
    <p class="headings">Our Mission</p>
    <p>Higher education can be expensive, and many students miss out on opportunities simply because they are unaware of available scholarships. Our mission is to bridge this gap by providing a platform that curates and organizes scholarships in a simple, accessible way, helping students easily find and apply for the financial aid they deserve.</p>
        
    <p class="headings">How It Works</p>
       <p>Our website is designed to streamline the scholarship search process. Students can explore a vast collection of scholarships, filter them based on eligibility criteria, and receive timely updates on application deadlines. We aim to make the process hassle-free so that students can focus on their education rather than worrying about finances.</p> 
        
        <p class="headings">Our Story</p>
        <p>As students, we faced the challenge of navigating through scattered and confusing scholarship information. This inspired us to create a centralized platform that not only lists scholarships but also provides clear details and guidance. We believe that every student should have equal access to financial aid, and this platform is our step toward making that a reality.</p>
        
        <p class="headings" >Contact Us</p>
        <p>We are constantly working to improve and expand our platform. If you have any suggestions, questions, or need assistance, feel free to reach out to us. Together, letâ€™s make education more accessible for everyone!</p>
